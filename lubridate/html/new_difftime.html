<h2>Create a difftime object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>new_difftime creates a difftime object with the specified
number of units. Entries for different units are
cumulative. difftime displays durations in various units,
but these units are estimates given for convenience. The
underlying object is always recorded as a fixed number of
seconds. For display and creation purposes, units are
converted to seconds using their most common lengths in
seconds. Minutes = 60 seconds, hours = 3600 seconds, days
= 86400 seconds, weeks = 604800. Units larger than weeks
are not used due to their variability.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  new_difftime(...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of time units to be included in the
difftime and their amounts. Seconds, minutes, hours,
days, and weeks are supported.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Conceptually, difftime objects are a type of duration.
They measure the exact passage of time but do not always
align with measurements made in larger units of time such
as hours, months and years. This is because the length of
larger time units can be affected by conventions such as
leap years and Daylight Savings Time. lubridate provides
a second class for measuring durations, the Duration
class.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
new_difftime(second = 90)
# Time difference of 1.5 mins
new_difftime(minute = 1.5)
# Time difference of 1.5 mins
new_difftime(second = 3, minute = 1.5, hour = 2, day = 6, week = 1)
# Time difference of 13.08441 days
new_difftime(hour = 1, minute = -60)
# Time difference of 0 secs
new_difftime(day = -1)
# Time difference of -1 days
