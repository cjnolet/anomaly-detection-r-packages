<h2>Description of time span classes in lubridate.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A time span can be measured in three ways: as a duration,
an interval, or a period.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Durations record the exact number of seconds in a time
span. They measure the exact passage of time but do not
always align with measurements made in larger units of
time such as hours, months and years. This is because the
exact length of larger time units can be affected by
conventions such as leap years and Daylight Savings Time.
Base R measures durations with the difftime class.
lubridate provides an additional class, the duration
class, to facilitate working with durations.
</p>
<p>durations display as the number of seconds that occur
during a time span. If the number is large, a duration
object will also display the length in a more convenient
unit, but these measurements are only estimates given for
convenience. The underlying object is always recorded as
a fixed number of seconds. For display and creation
purposes, units are converted to seconds using their most
common lengths in seconds. Minutes = 60 seconds, hours =
3600 seconds, days = 86400 seconds. Units larger than
days are not used due to their variability.
</p>
<p>duration objects can be easily created with the helper
functions <code><a href="dseconds.html">dweeks</a></code>, <code><a href="dseconds.html">ddays</a></code>,
<code><a href="dseconds.html">dhours</a></code>, <code><a href="dseconds.html">dminutes</a></code> and
<code><a href="dseconds.html">dseconds</a></code>. These objects can be added to and
subtracted from date- times to create a user interface
similar to object oriented programming. Duration objects
can be added to Date, POSIXct, and POSIXlt objects to
return a new date-time.
</p>
<p>Periods record the change in the clock time between two
date-times. They are measured in common time related
units: years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer
values. With the exception of seconds, none of these
units have a fixed length. Leap years, leap seconds, and
Daylight Savings Time can expand or contract a unit of
time depending on when it occurs.  For this reason,
periods do not have a fixed length until they are paired
with a start date. Periods can be used to track changes
in clock time. Because periods have a variable length,
they must be paired with a start date as an interval
(<code><a href="as.interval.html">as.interval</a></code>) before they can be accurately
converted to and from durations.
</p>
<p>Period objects can be easily created with the helper
functions <code><a href="seconds.html">years</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/weekday.POSIXt.html">months</a></code>,
<code><a href="seconds.html">weeks</a></code>, <code><a href="seconds.html">days</a></code>,
<code><a href="seconds.html">minutes</a></code>, <code><a href="seconds.html">seconds</a></code>. These
objects can be added to and subtracted to date-times to
create a user interface similar to object oriented
programming. Period objects can be added to Date,
POSIXct, and POSIXlt objects to return a new date-time.
</p>
<p>Intervals are time spans bound by two real date-times.
Intervals can be accurately converted to periods and
durations. Since an interval is anchored to a fixed
moment of time, the exact length of all units of time
during the interval can be calculated. To accurately
convert between periods and durations, a period or
duration should first be converted to an interval with
<code><a href="as.interval.html">as.interval</a></code>. An interval displays as the
start and end points of the time span it represents.
