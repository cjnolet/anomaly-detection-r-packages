<h2>Create a period object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>period creates a period object with the specified values.
period provides the behaviour of <code><a href="new_period.html">new_period</a></code>
in a way that is more suitable for automating within a
function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  period(num, units = "second")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector that lists the number of time
units to be included in the period</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector that lists the type of
units to be used. The units in units are matched to the
values in num according to their order.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Within a Period object, time units do not have a fixed
length (except for seconds) until they are added to a
date-time. The length of each time unit will depend on
the date-time to which it is added. For example, a year
that begins on 2009-01-01 will be 365 days long.  A year
that begins on 2012-01-01 will be 366 days long. When
math is performed with a period object, each unit is
applied separately. How the length of a period is
distributed among its units is non-trivial. For example,
when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60
seconds.
</p>
<p>Periods track the change in the &quot;clock time&quot; between two
date-times. They are measured in common time related
units: years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer
values.
</p>
<p>Period objects can be easily created with the helper
functions <code><a href="seconds.html">years</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/weekday.POSIXt.html">months</a></code>,
<code><a href="seconds.html">weeks</a></code>, <code><a href="seconds.html">days</a></code>,
<code><a href="seconds.html">minutes</a></code>, <code><a href="seconds.html">seconds</a></code>. These
objects can be added to and subtracted to date-times to
create a user interface similar to object oriented
programming.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a period object

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
period(c(90, 5), c("second", "minute"))
#  "5M 90S"
period(-1, "days")
# "-1d 0H 0M 0S"
period(c(3, 1, 2, 13, 1), c("second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week"))
# "20d 2H 1M 3S"
period(c(1, -60), c("hour", "minute"))
# "1H -60M 0S"
period(0, "second")
# "0S"
</pre>
