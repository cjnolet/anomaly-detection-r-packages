<h2>Create a period object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>new_period creates a period object with the specified
values. Within a Period object, time units do not have a
fixed length (except for seconds) until they are added to
a date-time. The length of each time unit will depend on
the date-time to which it is added. For example, a year
that begins on 2009-01-01 will be 365 days long.  A year
that begins on 2012-01-01 will be 366 days long. When
math is performed with a period object, each unit is
applied separately. How the length of a period is
distributed among its units is non-trivial. For example,
when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60
seconds.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  new_period(...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of time units to be included in the
period and their amounts. Seconds, minutes, hours, days,
weeks, months, and years are supported.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Periods track the change in the &quot;clock time&quot; between two
date-times. They are measured in common time related
units: years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer
values.
</p>
<p>Period objects can be easily created with the helper
functions <code><a href="seconds.html">years</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/weekday.POSIXt.html">months</a></code>,
<code><a href="seconds.html">weeks</a></code>, <code><a href="seconds.html">days</a></code>,
<code><a href="seconds.html">minutes</a></code>, <code><a href="seconds.html">seconds</a></code>. These
objects can be added to and subtracted to date-times to
create a user interface similar to object oriented
programming.
</p>
<p>new_period is meant to be used interactively on the
command line. See <code><a href="period.html">period</a></code>, for a version
that is better suited to automating within a function.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
new_period (second = 90, minute = 5)
# "5M 90S"
new_period(day = -1)
# "-1d 0H 0M 0S"
new_period(second = 3, minute = 1, hour = 2, day = 13, week = 1)
# "20d 2H 1M 3S"
new_period(hour = 1, minute = -60)
# "1H -60M 0S"
new_period(second = 0)
# "0S"
