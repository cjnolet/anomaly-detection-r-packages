<h2>Set the Armadillo Random Number Generator to the given value</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set the Armadillo Random Number Generator to the given
value
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
armadillo_set_seed(val)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>val</code></td>
<td>
<p>The seed used to initialize Armadillo's random
number generator.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Depending on whether RcppArmadillo was compiled for the
C++98 standard (currently the default) or for C++11
(optional), two different RNGs may be used. This function
resets either. For C++98, the system library RNG is used.
It may have poor performance, particularly on older
versions of Windows. For C++11, the RNG included in its
library is used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function is invoked for its side effect and has no
return value.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This has been found to not work as espected in
<span class="pkg">RStudio</span> as its code also uses the system RNG library.
You may have to either not run within <span class="pkg">RStudio</span> or
change your code to use a different RNG such as the one
from R.
</p>

via <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span>.
